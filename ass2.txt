Start with the second element (index 1) of the array. Assume that the first element (index 0) is already sorted.
Pick the current element (arr[i]) and store it in a temporary variable.
Compare the current element (arr[i]) with the elements in the sorted portion of the array, from index 0 to i-1.
While moving from right to left (from i-1 down to 0) within the sorted portion, check if the current element is smaller than the element at the current position.
If it is smaller,
    shift the larger element one position to the right to make space for the current element.
Repeat this process until you find the correct position for the current element within the sorted portion of the array.
Insert the current element into the correct position within the sorted sequence (the elements from 0 to i-1).
Move on to the next element (i++) and repeat the process until you've sorted the entire array
End
